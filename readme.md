# ðŸŽ¯Project Name - Gossipia : Gossips uncovered, secrets exposed!

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Hat-trick Hackers (From CUCEK)

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Harigovind M G -Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad,CUSAT
- Member 2:  Treesa George - Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad,CUSAT
- Member 3:  Anna Michael -  Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad,CUSAT

### Project Description
Gossipia is a fun and light-hearted online platform where users can anonymously share and discover juicy gossip, scandals, and rumors. These posts are stored forever, creating a persistent "gossip archive." Dive into the unfiltered submissions, indulge in the latest scoops, and join the conversation. No holds barred, no secrets kept. Gossipia is just a way to immortalize random, trivial rumorsâ€¦ purely for fun!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Gossip withdrawal symptoms due to lack of juicy, unverified, and potentially scandalous information

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- If an anonymous user shares a gossip with a secret code just like a password then he/she can delete it just by using that password
- Submit anonymous gossip (because secrets are too mainstream)
- Unfiltered, uncensored, and utterly unverified (you've been warned)
