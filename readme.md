### Project Description
A fun, pointless app where users can submit gossips as an anonymous one or as a verified one.
It gets stored forever, creating an unchangeable “gossip chain.” It’s completely decentralized
and doesn’t verify or fact-check anything—just a way to immortalize random, trivial rumors...
